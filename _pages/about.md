Video imaging offers many advantages over conventional imaging employing long exposures:
* Readout time is negligible
* Physical shutters, guiders, or de-rotators are not required
* Sidereal and non-sidereal guiding can be performed simultaneously using digital stacking
* Photometric and seeing can be monitored in real time 
* Transient artifacts such as cosmic ray hits and satellite trails can easily be removed
* The blurring effects of the atmosphere can be mitigated using either Lucky imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_imaging) or more advanced image reconstruction techniques

#### Here is an example of DanceCam working on a real video stream of the central core of M92

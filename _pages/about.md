### Video imaging offers many advantages over conventional long exposures:

### ![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/magnifier.png){: style="display:inline; height:24pt"} Image quality

* Transient artifacts such as cosmic ray hits and [satellite trails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_flare) can easily be removed

* The blurring effects of the atmosphere can be mitigated using either [Lucky imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_imaging), "rubber focal plane" or more advanced image reconstruction techniques


### ![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/snail.png){: style="display:inline; height:24pt"} Efficiency

* Readout time is negligible

* Physical shutters, guiders, or de-rotators are not required


### ![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/stack.png){: style="display:inline; height:24pt"} Image stacking

* Sidereal and non-sidereal guiding can be performed simultaneously using digital image stacking


### ![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/monitor.png){: style="display:inline; height:24pt"} Image monitoring

* Photometric and seeing can be monitored in real time
